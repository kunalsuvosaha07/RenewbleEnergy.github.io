            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Biomass has been in use since people first began burning wood to cook food and keep warm. Wood is still the largest biomass energy resource today. Other sources include food crops, grassy and woody plants, residues from agriculture or forestry, oil-rich algae, and the organic component of municipal and industrial wastes. Even the fumes from landfills (which contain methane, the main component in natural gas) can be used as a biomass energy source.

                Biomass can be used for fuels, power production, and products that would otherwise be made from fossil fuels.
                
                NREL's vision is to develop technology for biorefineries that will convert biomass into a range of valuable fuels, chemicals, materials, and productsâ€”much like oil refineries and petrochemical plants do.

                Biofuels
                Biofuels are transportation fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, created by converting biomass into liquid fuels to meet transportation needs. Learn more about biofuels.
                
                Biopower
                Biopower technologies convert renewable biomass fuels into heat and electricity using one of three processes: burning, bacterial decay, and conversion to gas/liquid fuel.
                
                Bioproducts
                In addition to electricity and fuels, biomass can also be converted into chemicals for making plastics and other products that typically are made from petroleum..</p>
